# myFriends To-Do List

## Front-end
- [ ] Go through the following: [HowToTestFrontEnd.com](https://howtotestfrontend.com/courses/jest-vitest-fundamentals "A Vitest tutorial") to add tests to the front-end

## Back-end

- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Add functional tests (probably for main.go but verify first)
- [ ] Design acceptance tests
- [ ] Add performance tests
- [ ] Make util.ReportHttpError modular, so that you can specify the errorMessage and errorCode as arguments
- [ ] (OPTIONAL) Add smoke tests

## Other

- [ ] Add end-to-end tests
- [ ] Plan out UI/routing design, what the application is actually gonna look like when it's done, so we know what to code and how to structure the code
- [ ] Add said routes, and figure out if that's something on the front or backend (like should I just have a different React root node in each route's <body>?)
- [ ] For every line of code, run it through an LLM and ask it "how would a senior dev write this"
